# VNC, ROS and Gnome

This repository defines a docker image based on Ubuntu 16.04, packed with ROS Kinetic and a Gnome GUI through VNC.
It gives a ready-to-use environment to run the material presented on [Serial Robotics](https://serial-robotics.org) and available at [ros-playground](https://github.com/cyrillg/ros-playground).

For convenience, a Command-Line Interface (CLI) is provided under `utils/bash_cli`. Check out the associated README for more information.

Once your container is running, you can connect to the desktop with RealVNC, VNC client available as a Chrome extension (other VNC clients might do, but this one has been proven to work). The address is `localhost:5900`.
